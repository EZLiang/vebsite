    There's a 2009 article by Arai<sup><a href="#arai09">[1]</a></sup> on interated recursive Mahloness. The main idea of the paper is that stronger systems of reflection can be analysed in terms of iterated $\Pi_2$-reflection.
</p>

<p>
    In section 5, Arai writes the following:
    <blockquote>
        A $\Pi_3$-reflecting ordinal $K$ is understood to be $<\varepsilon_{K+1}$[-ply]-recursively Mahlo.
    </blockquote>
    The implication here is that in terms of strength, the existence of a $\Pi_3$-reflecting is <em>equivalent</em> to the existence of a $K$ that is $<\varepsilon_{K+1}$-ply-recursively Mahlo.
</p>

<p>
    So a $\Pi_3$-reflecting is equivalent, in some sense, to a $K$ that is $F(\varepsilon_{K+1})$-ply-recursively Mahlo, were $F(\alpha)=\alpha$. Now the question is: what are the &lsquo;Arai functions&rsquo; for higher reflecting ordinals?
</p>

<p id="target01">
    For a $\Pi_2$-reflecting, the Arai function is (obviously) $1$. For a $\Pi_{n+1}$-reflecting, the arai function is $F(x)=x^{G(x)}$ where $G$ is the Arai function for $\Pi_n$-reflection.
</p>

<p>
    The final cases are $X$-reflecting ordinals that are also $\Pi_n$-reflecting onto $Y$-reflecting ordinals. Suppose the Arai function for $X$-reflection is $x^{x^{\ldots^{G(x)}}}$ with $n-2$ $x$s and that for $Y$-reflection is $x^{x^{\ldots^{H(x)}}}$ with $n-2$ $x$s, then the Arai function for $X$-reflecting ordinals that are also $\Pi_n$-reflecting onto $Y$-reflecting ordinals is $x^{x^{\ldots^{H(x)+G(x)}}}$.
</p>

<h1>Collapsing functions</h1>

<p>
    Fortunately, Arai has a solution for that. First, we agree to notate Arai functions by the value of $F(K)$, where $K$ is some suitable large ordinal. Essentially, given an iterated Mahlo hierarchy $M$ and Skolem hulls $C$, define $\psi^\alpha_\kappa(\beta)$ to be the least ordinal $\pi$ that is in $M^\alpha$ and such that $C(\beta,\pi)\cap\kappa=\pi$.
</p>

<p>
    Since defining $C$ is trivial, we focus on defining $M$. We see that the definition must somehow unpack the Arai function $F$ knowing $F(K)$. However, there are ordinals not described by Arai functions, such as $\kappa$ which are $\kappa$-ply-recursively Mahlo, and are important to reach the full strength of reflection. So we instead notate Arai functions by the value of $F(\varepsilon_{K+1})$. To obtain the original Arai function, the solution is the standard diagonalization trick:
</p>

<p>
    $M^\alpha$ is the set of $\kappa$ such that:
    <ul>
        <li>$\kappa< K$</li>
        <li>$C(\alpha,\kappa)\cap K=\kappa$</li>
        <li>For all $\beta\in C(\alpha,\kappa)\cap\alpha$, $\kappa$ is $\Pi_2$-reflecting on $M^\beta$</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    For completeness, we also define the Skolem hulls $C(\alpha,\kappa)$ as the colsure of $\kappa\cup\{0,K,\varepsilon_{K+1}\}$ under:
    <ul>
        <li>$\beta+\gamma$</li>
        <li>$K^\beta$</li>
        <li>$\psi^\beta_\kappa(\gamma)$, provided $\beta,\gamma<\alpha$</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    If we restrict our ordinals to be below $\varepsilon_{K+1}$, then <em>voil&#x00E0;</em>, we have rediscovered Rathjen's $\Psi$, modulo &ldquo;technical convenience&rdquo; (Rathjen's wording).
</p>

<h1>Degrees of Reflection</h1>

<p>
    Those of you familiar with Taranovsky may have noticed a resemblance between the Arai function assignments <a href="#target01">above</a> and Taranovsky's Degrees of Reflection<sup><a href="#tar">[2]</a></sup>. Indeed, if the Arai function is $F$, then the Taranovsky degree is $\Omega^{F(\Omega)}$.
</p>

<p>
    Thus, we can use this to analyse DoR. Note that both DoR and our $\Pi_n$-ref OCF both have additional structure beyond the Arai functions.
