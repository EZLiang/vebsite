<p>Hello, I'm back again with some more large ordinals! It turned out that the previous ordinal <span class="stk">notation</span> was a lot weaker than expected, so I made a way better <span class="stk">notation</span>.</p>

<p>So, today, we're gonna make an OCF for admissible ordinals and limits of them. It will also lead to a system of <a href="https://googology.wikia.org/wiki/Ordinal_notation#Nonrecursive_notations">fake ordinal notations</a> for super large ordinals.</p>

<p>Since we're making large admissible ordinals, the first thing to do is to turn Kleene's \(\mathcal{O}\) into an operator on sets:<br />
...<br />
Then we define the Kleene closure of a set, \(K(S)\). We partition the elements of \(S\) into ranges bounded by ordinals of cofinality \(\ge\omega\). (We treat 0 as cofinality \(\infty\).) There is no need to consider ranges upper bounded by a limit of such ordinals, for there is no ordinal between that sequence and its supremum, so any ordinals less than it will fall into another range. So we consider ranges of the form \([\alpha,\beta)\), for which the only ordinal of cofinality \(\ge\omega\) it contains it \(\alpha\). Then we express the intersection \(S\cap[\alpha,\beta)\) as \(\alpha+T\). Then we \(\mathcal{O}\)-transform \(T\) and add \(\alpha\), then take the union of all the transformed ranges to get the Kleene closure. 
</p>

<p>Now it's time to make our OCF! We follow Buchholz's OCF. A note on names: OCF names are confusing (traditionally limited to just a few greek letters), and out of those allowed, \(\Theta\) is the only one not used yet, so that will be our OCF name. Just like in that OCF and pretty much every other OCF, we define \(\Omega_\alpha\) similarly. And then we define the sets \(C^n_\nu(\alpha)\) as follows:
<ul>
<li>\(C^0_\nu(\alpha)\) consists of all ordinals \(&lt;\Omega_\nu\)</li>
<li>\(C^{n+1}_\nu(\alpha)\) is the union of the Kleene closure of \(S=C^n_\nu(\alpha)\), all ordinals that can be made by applying \(\Theta_\mu\) to ordinals below \(\alpha\) and \(\mu\in C^n_\nu(\alpha)\), \(\Omega_\alpha\) for all \(\alpha\in C^n_\nu(\alpha)\), and all sums, products, and exponents of ordinals from \(C^n_\nu(\alpha)\). (The last bit is necessary since Kleene closures are only useful for countable ordinals. For uncountable ordinals you need to encode much ore into integers and handle large cofinalities, and I have not yet found a simple model of computation that works. If the Kleene closure can be improved that way, the power of the system will undergo a dramatic increase.)</li>
<li>\(C_\nu(\alpha)\) is the union of \(C^n_\nu(\alpha)\) for nonnegative integers \(n\).</li>
</ul>
<br />And now, of course, \(\Theta_\nu(\alpha)\) is the smallest ordinal not in \(C^\nu(\alpha)\).
</p>
<p>With this, we can define fundamental sequences. If we have a countable limit ordinal \(\alpha\), it is either of the form \(\Theta_0(\beta)\) or it is below such a value. In the second case, there is a lowest such value by the well ordering property, and for that value's corresponding \(\beta\) there is a least \(n\) for which \(\alpha\in C^n_0(\gamma)\). It our ordinal in consideration is \(\omega\), then the fundamental sequence is trivial (\(\omega[n]=n\)), otherwise it must have been created by a Kleene closure. Then we can define a fs for it analagously to those of Kleene's \(\mathcal{O}\). So now if it is of the form \(\Theta_0(\beta)\), there are two cases. If the countable portions of the \(C^n_0(\beta)\) are eventually constant, like for the Church-Kleene ordinal, then the largest countable ordinals in the set must be in the Kleene closures and so we can use the lowest \(n\) for which it is constant, and define a fundamental sequence analagously to the Church-Kleene ordinal. Otherwise, then we can define \(\alpha[n]\) to be the supremum of \(C^n_0(\beta)\cap [0,\alpha)\).</p>
